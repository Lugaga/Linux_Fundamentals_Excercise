  ## Demystifying Linux for Cyber Security, featuring the Office Cast.

    Here is a few key things to keep in mind when we are following along.

    - It’s important to apply what we are learning here, Let's use this as a momentum to step up our 
      own learning journey for Linux.

    - Practice, practice, practice.
      Following along and completing this exercise is only part of the learning journey. 
      We need to practice on our own in order to retain what we have learnt.

    - Teach someone else!
      One way we can retain this information is by teaching someone else. 
      It doesn’t matter who it is (It can even be ourselves by making a video). --> Just like Flipgrid 
      but now practicals.

    I wish that this exercise will be beneficial to us, as we quest for more knowledge in cybersecurity.😎

           - Kevin Malone
           - Angela Martin
           - Oscar Martinez
           - Meredith Palmer


     3. Incident Responders
         - Phyllis Vance
         - Creed Bratton
         - Andy Bernard 
         - Erin Hannon 
         - Karen Filippelli


     4. Digital Forensics Examiners
         - Toby Flenderson
         - Stanley Hudson
         - Kelly Kapoor
         - Roy Anderson
         - Jan Levinson


     5. Penetration Testers
         - David Wallace
         - Gabe Lewis
         - Holly Flax
         - Robert California
         - Nellie Bertram
   
  We are tasked to:
  
        1. create the groups for the above mentioned teams. 
        2. Create all the users and add them to their respective groups(teams).
        3. Confirm (1) & (2).
        4. Create directories for all the 5 teams.
        5. Create a name.txt for all the engineers.
        6. Add bio details to each file name.txt of the engineers.
        7. Confirm (4) to (6).
        
        After completing task 1 to 7, we shall then use that data to practice a couple of Linux Commands on the CLI.
        
        Finally: Real progress takes time and effort, you have to draw from a deep well of patience and focus on the 
        process rather than the outcome. This way you can stay motivated and persistent, no matter how long it takes.
