  ## Demystifying Linux for Cyber Security featuring the Office Cast.

    Here is a few key things to keep in mind when you are following along.

    - It’s important to apply what you are learning, use this as a momentum to step up your own learning journey for Linux.

    - Practice, practice, practice.
      Following along and completing this exercise is only part of the learning journey. 
      You need to practice on your own in order to retain what you have learned.

    - Teach someone else!
      One way you can retain this information is by teaching someone else. 
      It doesn’t matter who it is (It can even be yourself by making a video). --> Just like Flipgrid but now practicals.

    I wish that this exercise will be beneficial to you as you advance in your learning journey for cybersecurity.😎
